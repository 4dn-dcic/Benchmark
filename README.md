# pipelines-cwl

This is a collection of pipelines built by 4DN-DCIC that are currently on the SevenBridges platform.
Some of them are the latest versions as of Aug 10 2017 but others are the latest versions as of Feb 23 2017.
The ones that are updated on Aug 10 2017 are: cooler, pairs2hic, merge-pairs, hi-c-processing-part, md5, fastqc-0-11-4-1, fastqc-0-11-4.

The content has been generated by the following command.
```
source download.sh 
```
For this to work, you need to have SBG_TOKEN as an environmental variable on your machine.



To convert sbg cwl to awsem cwl in a batch, do the following
```
source convert.sh
```
This one assumes Mac (`xargs -I{}` instead of `xargs -i`).
